## The Three Entities

### 1. ENTELECH - The Consulting Agency

**Core Functions**:
- Find RevOps and consulting clients needing AI transformation
- Sell scopes of work (automation, AI agents, enterprise SaaS features)
- Manage client relationships and expectations

- Handle partnership agreements (revshare/equity splits)

**Revenue Model**:
- Consulting fees from client engagements
- Retains 30-40% of project value for client acquisition and management
- Partnership equity/revshare from long-term client relationships

**Target Clients**:
- Enterprise SaaS companies needing agentic features
- SMBs requiring workflow automation
- RevOps departments seeking business process optimization
- Companies wanting in-house AI capabilities (DIY training)

**Example Engagement**:
> Enterprise SaaS company needs AI-powered customer support agent integrated with their existing platform. ENTELECH scopes the project at $50K, manages the client relationship, and coordinates delivery through AIIA consultant.

### 2. AIIA - The Talent Platform

**Purpose**: Recruit, train, vet, and place AI consultants

**Core Functions**:
- Source aspiring AI consultants and implementation specialists

## How the Ecosystem Works Together

### Client Engagement Flow

```
Step 1: Client Acquisition (ENTELECH)
  ├─ Identify client need (AI automation, agents, workflow optimization)
  ├─ Scope project and propose solution
  ├─ Determine engagement model (DFY, DIY, Hybrid)
  └─ Sign contract and partnership agreement

Step 2: Talent Sourcing (AIIA)
  ├─ ENTELECH requests consultant with specific skills
  ├─ AIIA matches vetted consultant to client needs
  ├─ Provide consultant profile and vetting report
  └─ Assign consultant to engagement

Step 3: Implementation (CONSULTANT via AIIA)
  ├─ Consultant works directly with client
  ├─ Implements AI features/automation/training
  ├─ ENTELECH oversees client relationship
  └─ AIIA monitors performance and KPIs

Step 4 (Optional): Advanced Build (ECHELON)
  ├─ For complex technical requirements
  ├─ ECHELON provides software infrastructure
  ├─ Consultant coordinates integration
  └─ Client receives complete solution

Step 5: Revenue Distribution
  ├─ Client pays ENTELECH
  ├─ ENTELECH retains 30-40% (acquisition + management)
  ├─ Consultant receives 40-50% (implementation)
  ├─ AIIA receives 10-20% (placement + monitoring)
  └─ ECHELON receives project fees (if involved)
```

## Three Service Models

### DFY (Do For You) - Full Implementation

**When to Use**:
- Client lacks in-house technical team
- Needs working solution quickly
- Wants ongoing support and maintenance

**Delivery Model**:
1. ENTELECH scopes project and manages client
2. AIIA provides implementation consultant
3. Consultant builds complete solution
4. ECHELON supports if advanced features needed
5. Client receives turnkey system

**Revenue Split Example** ($50K project):
- ENTELECH: $15K (30%) - Client acquisition and management
- Consultant: $25K (50%) - Full implementation
- AIIA: $10K (20%) - Placement and monitoring
- ECHELON: $0 (not needed for this project)

---

### DIY (Do It Yourself) - Training & Enablement

**When to Use**:
- Client has in-house team
- Wants to build internal AI capabilities
- Prefers knowledge transfer over outsourcing

**Delivery Model**:
1. ENTELECH scopes training engagement
2. AIIA provides consultant with teaching experience
3. Consultant trains client's team on AI implementation
4. Client team builds and maintains their own systems
5. Consultant provides ongoing advisory support

**Revenue Split Example** ($30K training engagement):
- ENTELECH: $10K (33%) - Client acquisition and management
- Consultant: $15K (50%) - Training delivery
- AIIA: $5K (17%) - Placement and monitoring

---

### Hybrid - Consulting + Implementation

**When to Use**:
- Client has some technical capability
- Needs expert guidance + critical component builds
- Wants to maintain and extend systems in-house

**Delivery Model**:
1. ENTELECH scopes hybrid engagement
2. AIIA provides consultant with consulting + technical skills
3. Consultant designs architecture and builds core features
4. Client team implements remaining features
5. Consultant provides ongoing advisory and code review

**Revenue Split Example** ($40K hybrid project):
- ENTELECH: $12K (30%) - Client acquisition and management
- Consultant: $20K (50%) - Consulting + core implementation
- AIIA: $8K (20%) - Placement and monitoring

---

## Partnership Agreements

### Standard Partnership Model

**For Each Client Engagement**:
- ENTELECH and selected partner (from AIIA network) co-deliver
- Revenue split per agreement (typically 30/50/20)
- ENTELECH handles client relationship
- Partner handles implementation/training
- AIIA provides quality assurance and monitoring

### Long-Term Partnership (Revshare/Equity)

**For Strategic Clients**:
- ENTELECH identifies high-value client with recurring needs
- Selects partner from AIIA network based on expertise
- Negotiate revshare or equity split on ongoing relationship
- Partner becomes dedicated to that client
- AIIA continues monitoring and support

**Example**:
> Enterprise SaaS client needs ongoing AI feature development. ENTELECH brings client, AIIA consultant implements features monthly. Instead of per-project fees, they agree to 40% ENTELECH / 40% Consultant / 20% AIIA split of all revenue from that client over 2 years.
